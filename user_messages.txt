we dont need create_circular anymore, and we also dont need create_circular symmetric which takes a vector of strings! put all the functionality into create_circular_symmetric(vector<rational>) and delete the other functions

[Message 2 - Timestamp: N/A]
do it!

[Message 3 - Timestamp: N/A]
delete all the error msg and safety checks in create_symmetric and create_circular_symmetric. these checks are already done in main.cpp! and we dont want the overhead!

[Message 4 - Timestamp: N/A]
do it!

[Message 5 - Timestamp: N/A]
build it!

[Message 6 - Timestamp: N/A]
do i have to write this-> here? why can it be skipped?

[Message 7 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes, remove!

[Message 8 - Timestamp: N/A]
build it!

[Message 9 - Timestamp: N/A]
why is the build so slow?

[Message 10 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes, change to 02! this is only for testing anyways, i will tell you when i want a proper release!

[Message 11 - Timestamp: N/A]
run the @run_matrices.py file and give me all the output!

[Message 12 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, now i am referring to the runtim!

[Message 13 - Timestamp: N/A]
can you make a runtime analysis?

[Message 14 - Timestamp: N/A]
in @run_matrices.py switch the log off!

[Message 15 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, i want a performance analysis! what is this tool called? valgrind or so?

[Message 16 - Timestamp: N/A]
perf is installed, try it again!

[Message 17 - Timestamp: N/A]
Test check check check I 1, 2, to restart The terminal. And then start with the grind.

[Message 18 - Timestamp: N/A]
run callgrind for this matrix: 22#2,2,4,4,5,5,4,4,2,2,-1

[Message 21 - Timestamp: N/A]
clear out every cache and also clear every build folder, only keep the files you need to rebuild everything!

[Message 22 - Timestamp: N/A]
rebuild everything!

[Message 23 - Timestamp: N/A]
set up the vs code file!

[Message 24 - Timestamp: N/A]
can i use the gui for debugging?

[Message 25 - Timestamp: N/A]
set up the vs code file!

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

[Message 28 - Timestamp: N/A]
run callgrind for 18#8,7,5,5,5,5,7,8,-1

[Message 29 - Timestamp: N/A]
create a python file in python/test called create_baslines.py where you run the_old_exe and recreate both baseline files. be aware that you have to change the matrices to the old style of input if they are not circular symmetric!

[Message 30 - Timestamp: N/A]
thex execute!

[Message 31 - Timestamp: N/A]
open cursor settings

[Message 32 - Timestamp: N/A]
extract all the messages i wrote and put it into a textfile!

[Message 33 - Timestamp: N/A]
can you put the timestamp it was written onto each message?

Eigen::PartialPivLU<Eigen::MatrixXd> lu(A); auto diag = lu.matrixLU().diagonal().cwiseAbs(); double minPivot = diag.minCoeff(); const double tol = std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon(); if (minPivot < tol) { // Only declare "no solution" for truly singular matrices std::cout << "No solution (matrix is singular)." << std::endl; } else { Eigen::VectorXd x = lu.solve(b); std::cout << "Solution: " << x.transpose() << std::endl; } take the code above as input! rewrite "find_candidate_double" with this method. change get_le_matrix such that we get the n+1 x n+1 square matrix, and the rhs goes into vector b

split get_le_mattrix for double in 2 function: 1. get the bordered n+1 x n+1 matrix 2. get the 0....0 1 vector b for dimension n+1 and i want to keep the matrix initialization in search_support_size and reuse the matrix as long as the n is the same!

what is result_le???

[Message 40 - Timestamp: N/A]
analyse the file @eigen_extensions.hpp! is it correct? is it good? if yes change find_candidate_rational such that you use the BareissLU for it!

[Message 41 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes!

[Message 42 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes! are you ready to implement?

compare your solution to the bug with this solution. is it the same? does it make sense?

[Message 47 - Timestamp: N/A]
@findeq.cpp (138-153) this part is almost the same for double/rational. create one new function which gets called by both find_candidate!

[Message 48 - Timestamp: N/A]
Recommendation: Option A with template, but use function overloads for threshold logic (SFINAE or if constexpr) implement it, with your recommendation!

[Message 49 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, i dont like the template solution! change it to just if/else staements depending if its double or rational

[Message 50 - Timestamp: N/A]
@findeq.cpp (147-161) do the same for this part

[Message 51 - Timestamp: N/A]
back to matrix.hpp: put the logic of create_from_cli_string into main.cpp, and create only 2 functions for creating matrices: 1. create_circular_symmetric: takes floor(n/2) values as rational or double. the functionality is the same as now! 2. create_symmetric: takes an upper triangular matrix, again either as rational or double. 3. the paramter "is_cs" should become a variable of @fracessa.cpp, and matrix.hpp should be a "regular" eigen matrix (double or rational)

[Message 52 - Timestamp: N/A]
update: a "general" matrix can never be the case from now on. also on the cli it is either a cicular symmetric matrix or a symmetric one (with n*(n+1)/2 values)

[Message 53 - Timestamp: N/A]

[Message 54 - Timestamp: N/A]
in verification_matrices.json and in @fracessa_verification_result_baseline.json adapt the format of matrices, which are NOT cirular symmetric. at the moment rowsxcolumns elements are given, but you should only write the correct number of elements for symmetric matrices. also double check that these matrices are really symmetric!

[Message 55 - Timestamp: N/A]
something in @run_matrices.py is not working! pls check!

[Message 56 - Timestamp: N/A]
ok, symmetrise the matrices 2,3,4,5 by using A_new = (A+A')/2! use the rational format like it is already used!

[Message 57 - Timestamp: N/A]
i still got problems with matrix 3 and 5! analyse!

[Message 58 - Timestamp: N/A]
wait pls! i provided you with an old exe in "the_old_exe" folder. pls run matrices 3,4 and 5 in there (with the candidates) and compare. run the original non-symmetric matrices there AND also the new symmetric ones!

[Message 59 - Timestamp: N/A]
i set all 34 matrices to "true" again. run the whole test, and update both verification files with the results!

extract all the messages i have written, if possible with timestamp, if not possible then with a numbering and add it to @user_messages.txt

[Message 64 - Timestamp: N/A]
create an eigenbase for the rational class!

[Message 65 - Timestamp: N/A]
execute!

[Message 66 - Timestamp: N/A]
look at the runtime of the new bitset class, it almost doubled for matrix id 32. why is this the case? where is the bottleneck?

[Message 67 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, i want something else, can you modify the bitset64 class such that it only consists of one uint64_t? all the other info has to be provided by the caller when necessary

[Message 68 - Timestamp: N/A]
try no to use any bounds check. the class gets only called from fracessa and matrix, so we have control of the parameters. bounds check cost too much, and the class has to be super fast. remove all the bound checks every where else! after that, execute the plan!

[Message 69 - Timestamp: N/A]
ok, one thing i totally forgot! assume that the matrices have a maximal dimension of 64!

[Message 70 - Timestamp: N/A]
save a backup to github

[Message 71 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, revert to the last saved repo on github!

[Message 72 - Timestamp: N/A]
std::bitset<64>(kay_vee[0].to_uint64()).to_string()) create a function to_bitstring in @bitset64.hpp which replaces the output of std::bitset64. it should take dimension as a parameter, and only output the digits necessary. eg. dimension=5, then a stringoutput would be 10011.

[Message 73 - Timestamp: N/A]
you use nbits for the size parameter all the time, correct? if yes and also use nbits in to_bitstring

[Message 74 - Timestamp: N/A]
i want you to replace the matrix class with a "super fast" matrix class. the functionality should stay absolutely the same, ie. all the calls from fracessa dont change, but the internal structure of the matrx should be super fast. do not delete the old class, just create a new one

[Message 75 - Timestamp: N/A]
think also about this points: Use aligned memory for SIMD Implement small buffer optimization (stack for small matrices) Add cache-blocking for large operations Consider expression templates to eliminate temporaries Profile-guided optimization is essential

[Message 76 - Timestamp: N/A]
ok, do nto use expression templates, this is overkill at the moment. also try not to change the linear albgebra optimisations, this will be a separate step. take the following code as input, does it help you somehow or give you better ideas?

[Message 77 - Timestamp: N/A]
update the includes!

[Message 78 - Timestamp: N/A]
ok, something does not work with the matrix class. analyse the output of @run_matrices.py, there are some errors!

[Message 79 - Timestamp: N/A]
mhh, there is no performance gain compared to before! why is this?

[Message 80 - Timestamp: N/A]
@matrix_fast.hpp (89-91) ok, can you replace this somehow? why do we need to fill a new matrix with zeroes? it is not ncessary! when we need a zero matrx then zero_matrix is called!

[Message 81 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes, apply!

[Message 82 - Timestamp: N/A]
yes!

[Message 83 - Timestamp: N/A]
no, undo the last changes. initialize the rational object when it is called, eg. this line: A._data[i] = rational(elements[i]); but not before! this is only a problem at initialization....

[Message 84 - Timestamp: N/A]
apply the changes!

[Message 85 - Timestamp: N/A]
but wait, can i write a rational object on the stack? does that make sense?

[Message 86 - Timestamp: N/A]
but sizeof(T) is not constant! does that create a problem?

[Message 87 - Timestamp: N/A]
ok, just for trying it out: find every use of matrix_fast and write construct_at if applicable, in all necessary files!

[Message 88 - Timestamp: N/A]
Command failed with return code -6: malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size i get this error message, what can it be?

[Message 89 - Timestamp: N/A]
check @matrix.hpp for which functions are in use! give me a list of unused functions!

[Message 90 - Timestamp: N/A]
rename _matrix with _data in matrix.hpp

[Message 91 - Timestamp: N/A]
download eigen from gitlab and put it into third_party!

[Message 92 - Timestamp: N/A]
create an eigenbase for the rational class!

[Message 93 - Timestamp: N/A]
this is not the whole history! there is much more in there!
